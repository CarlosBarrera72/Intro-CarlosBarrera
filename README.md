# Hello Everyone
Hello, Everyone
I am Carlos Barrera a Full Stack Software Engineer, based out of Southern California Los Angeles.

Being told you cant do something or wont be able to succeed in a certain area is my place to shine. I love to prove people wrong no task is impossible
if you have time and commitment to it. I am new to the tech field after serving 8 years in the United States Marine Corps where I learned that proving
everyone who doubts me wrong.

I enjoy building, creating, and fixing applications for easier client services. Langueages that I am familiar with are: C#, JavaScript, and SQL.

I have worked with React.JS for front-end Javascirpt framework, ASP.NET Core 6.0 in C# for serverside development. I use MS SQL Server for backend database design and structuring. I have worked in an agile environment with daily stand-up, weekly sprints, and have conducted code-reviews with peers.

I enjoy to learn thats the reason why I chose to become a Software Engineer, the opportunities to learn never stop.
